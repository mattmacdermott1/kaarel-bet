run some experiments!

see experimentlog.md for progress on them


Separately:

- A current flaw is that using the most recent results dir as input for each of my scripts could lead to mixups if I run multiple scripts at the same time. This should be fix somehow
- Implement the control and have the control results be used in the plot (with a config field that can either run a control experiment or point to a control results dir for the plot)
- (Once I've run mini, mega and nano all on the same thing) Implement a plot with the results for all the models together
